# Rune-Server


<b>Limitless FTP server,</b>

with a focus on being cozy and homely.

<h4>SETUP:<h4>

~ set up is really simple ~~

1. Navigate to the main repo folder "/Note-Server" in a terminal
2. run command "pip install -e ."   <-- dont forget the dot!
3. run command "cd noteserver"
4. run command "set FLASK_APP=server.py"
5. run command "flask run --host=0.0.0.0"

This 'host=0.0.0.0' exposes your server to the network, so remember to block port 5000 on your router

Enjoy limitless file transfers :)!
